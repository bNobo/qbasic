# First programs I've written on PC

I was about 10 years old when I discovered programming with my Sinclair ZX81. A few years later I discovered Omikron Basic on my Atari 520 STE and QBASIC on my syster's PC.

Recently I was cleaning hard drives on my good old PC and found a backup of programs I've written almost 30 years ago. It makes me feel a little bit nostalgic so I decided to share them on Github.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) in order to run QB.EXE.

## List of files (Alphabetically)

### A.BAS

A subroutine to ask user for its name and record it.
